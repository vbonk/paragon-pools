    title: "About Mike Henry",
    paragraphs: [
      "Mike Henry began his career in the pool industry as a laborer in the early 1970s, working for a large pool company. Over the years, he immersed himself in every stage of pool construction — from excavation to finishing — gaining hands-on expertise that would become the foundation of his business.",
      "After working his way up and developing deep knowledge of pool design and sales, Mike branched out on his own and founded Paragon Pool and Patio, Inc. in 1990. His vision was simple: provide homeowners with well-built, private pools backed by honest service and competitive pricing.",
      "Today, more than 35 years later, Mike is still on-site for every Paragon project, personally supervising to ensure everything goes according to plan. That hands-on commitment is what sets Paragon apart from larger competitors.",
