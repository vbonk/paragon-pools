      heading: "The Two Main Inground Pool Types in Minnesota",
      content:
        "When homeowners in the Twin Cities start shopping for an inground pool, the choice usually comes down to vinyl liner or fiberglass. Concrete (gunite) pools exist but are rarely built in Minnesota due to cost and climate challenges. After building pools in Minnesota since 1990, we specialize in steel wall vinyl liner pools — and there are specific reasons why this construction method dominates the Minnesota market.",

      heading: "Vinyl Liner Pools: How They're Built",
      content:
        "A vinyl liner pool starts with excavation, then 14-gauge steel walls are set on a concrete footing with sono tubes for structural support. Plumbing is run underground, and a custom-measured vinyl liner is fitted over the steel walls and pool floor. The liner is the waterproofing membrane — everything behind it provides the structural framework. Our packages use Latham liners in 20mil and 27mil thicknesses with a wide range of pattern and color options. The liner typically lasts 8-12 years before replacement.",

      heading: "Fiberglass Pools: How They're Built",
      content:
        "A fiberglass pool is a pre-manufactured one-piece shell that's delivered by truck and lowered into an excavated hole with a crane. The shell is backfilled with gravel or sand, plumbing is connected, and the patio is poured around it. Installation is faster — often 1-2 weeks — but the pool is limited to the shapes and sizes the manufacturer produces. You can't customize the dimensions to fit an unusual yard.",

      heading: "Cost Comparison",
      content:
        "Vinyl liner pools generally cost less upfront than fiberglass. Our complete 18x36 vinyl liner package starts at $51,995 with all equipment included. A comparable fiberglass pool in Minnesota typically runs $55,000-75,000 depending on the manufacturer and model, plus equipment is often quoted separately. Over 20 years, you'll replace the vinyl liner 2-3 times at $4,000-6,000 each time, which narrows the total cost of ownership gap. However, the lower upfront cost of vinyl liner makes it accessible to more families.",

      heading: "Minnesota Climate Performance",
      content:
        "This is where the debate gets interesting. Minnesota's freeze-thaw cycle is the toughest test for any pool construction. Vinyl liner pools with steel walls and concrete footings handle ground movement well — the steel flexes slightly, and the liner accommodates minor shifting. Fiberglass pools can develop hairline cracks in the gel coat if the ground shifts unevenly during freeze-thaw cycles, though modern fiberglass is more flexible than it used to be. Both types need proper drainage and construction to perform in our climate.",

    {
      heading: "Customization and Size Options",
      content:
        "Vinyl liner pools win on customization. Since the steel walls are built on-site, the pool can be any rectangular dimension that fits your yard — 14x28, 18x36, 20x40, or anything in between. L-shapes, T-shapes, and custom configurations are possible. Fiberglass pools come in pre-set shapes and sizes from the manufacturer. If the manufacturer makes a 16x32 freeform but you want an 18x36 rectangle, you're out of luck. For homeowners with specific size requirements or unusual yard dimensions, vinyl liner is the more flexible option.",

      heading: "Maintenance and Longevity",
      content:
        "Fiberglass has a smooth gel coat surface that resists algae and requires slightly fewer chemicals. Vinyl liners can be punctured by sharp objects and need replacement every 8-12 years. However, vinyl liners are straightforward and affordable to replace — a new liner transforms the look of your pool. Fiberglass gel coat can fade, blister, or crack over time, and refinishing a fiberglass pool is significantly more expensive than replacing a vinyl liner. Both pool types use the same equipment (pumps, filters, heaters, covers) and require the same seasonal maintenance.",

      heading: "Our Recommendation for Minnesota Homeowners",
      content:
        "After building pools in Minnesota for over 35 years, we believe steel wall vinyl liner pools offer the best combination of value, customization, and climate performance for our region. That's why every package we offer uses this construction method with 14-gauge steel walls, concrete footings, and Latham liners. The lower upfront cost, unlimited size options, and proven freeze-thaw performance make it the right choice for most Twin Cities families. Visit our Willernie showroom or call (651) 653-6807 to see liner samples and discuss your project.",
