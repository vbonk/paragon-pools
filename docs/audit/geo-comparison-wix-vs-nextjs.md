## 1. Executive Summary

### The Bottom Line

Your old Wix website scored **35 out of 100** on our Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) audit — a "Critical" rating that means AI assistants like ChatGPT, Google AI Overview, Perplexity, and Siri were largely unable to find, understand, or recommend your business.

Your new custom-built website scores **67 out of 100** — a "Fair" rating representing a **32-point improvement (+91%)**. AI systems can now read your site, extract your business data, and cite you when someone asks "Who builds pools near Stillwater, MN?"

```

### Composite Score Card

| Category | Wix Score | New Site Score | Change | Weighted Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI Citability | 38/100 | 77/100 | **+39** | +9.75 pts |
| Brand Authority | 42/100 | 42/100 | 0 | 0.00 pts |
| Content E-E-A-T | 45/100 | 74/100 | **+29** | +5.80 pts |
| Technical GEO | 18/100 | 90/100 | **+72** | +10.80 pts |
| Schema & Structured Data | 12/100 | 65/100 | **+53** | +5.30 pts |
| Platform Optimization | 42/100 | 42/100 | 0 | 0.00 pts |
| **Composite GEO Score** | **35/100** | **67/100** | **+32 (+91%)** | **+31.65 pts** |

### What This Means in Plain English

- **Before:** When someone asked ChatGPT "Who builds inground pools near Stillwater, MN?", your business was invisible. AI couldn't read your Wix site, couldn't find structured data to extract, and had almost nothing quotable to work with.

- **After:** AI systems can now read every page, extract your business details (owner, locations, hours, packages, pricing), and cite specific facts like "$51,995 for a complete 18x36 package" or "BBB A+ rated since 1998."

- **What's left:** The remaining 33 points to reach 100 are primarily off-site work — getting more customer reviews, claiming your Yelp and Google profiles, and building the kind of third-party authority that AI systems trust. The website itself is doing its job; now the business presence needs to catch up.

## 2. What Is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)?

### The Shift from "Search" to "Ask"

For 25 years, getting found online meant ranking on Google's first page of blue links. Customers would type "pool builder near me," scroll through results, and click a website.

That era is ending. Today, customers increasingly **ask** instead of **search**:

> "Hey Siri, who builds inground pools near Stillwater?"
> "ChatGPT, what does an inground pool cost in Minnesota?"
> "Google, compare pool builders in the Twin Cities area."

These AI systems don't show a list of links. They read websites, synthesize information, and **give one answer**. If your site isn't structured for AI to understand, you don't appear in that answer — and the customer never knows you exist.

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is the practice of building your website so that AI systems can find you, understand what you offer, and recommend you to potential customers.

### Traditional SEO vs. GEO

| Dimension | Traditional SEO | GEO |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Rank on Google's page 1 | Be cited in AI-generated answers |
| **Who reads your site** | Google's crawler (Googlebot) | 10+ AI crawlers (GPTBot, PerplexityBot, Claude, Gemini, Siri, etc.) |
| **What matters most** | Keywords, backlinks, page speed | Structured data, factual density, entity clarity |
| **Content format** | Written for humans, optimized for keywords | Written for humans, structured for machine extraction |
| **How customers find you** | Click a link in search results | AI reads your site and quotes you directly in its answer |
| **Winner-take-all?** | Top 10 results share traffic | AI often cites 1-3 sources — if you're not one, you get nothing |

### Industry Benchmarks

Based on our analysis of local business websites across industries:

| Website Type | Typical GEO Score | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Template website (Wix, Squarespace) with no SEO work | 15-30 | AI largely cannot read or cite the site |
| Template website with basic SEO | 25-40 | Some visibility, but missing structured data and AI access |
| Custom-built website with traditional SEO | 40-60 | Good human experience, but not optimized for AI extraction |
| Custom-built website with active GEO | 65-85 | Structured for AI, quotable content, strong entity signals |
| Enterprise-level GEO program | 80-95 | Full-stack optimization: content, schema, authority, platforms |

**Your Wix site (35)** fell in the "template with minimal SEO" range — typical for Wix sites in the home services industry.

**Your new site (67)** places you in the "active GEO" range — ahead of virtually all competitors in the Minnesota pool builder space.

### Why This Matters Now

AI-assisted search is not a future trend — it's happening today. Google AI Overviews now appear on over 40% of US searches. ChatGPT has 200+ million weekly active users. Perplexity processes millions of queries daily. Apple Intelligence with Siri is on every new iPhone.

The pool and spa industry is particularly impacted because customers ask complex, high-value questions:
- "What does it cost to build a pool in Minnesota?" (high purchase intent)
- "Who's the best pool builder in the Twin Cities?" (direct recommendation request)
- "How long does pool installation take?" (decision-stage question)

These are exactly the queries where AI systems synthesize an answer from the best-structured sources. Being invisible to AI means being invisible to a growing share of your highest-intent prospects.

## 3. Score Card — Full Comparison

### Master Comparison Table

| # | Category | Weight | Wix Score | Wix Weighted | Next.js Score | Next.js Weighted | Delta | Weighted Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AI Citability | 25% | 38 | 9.50 | 77 | 19.25 | +39 | +9.75 |
| 2 | Brand Authority | 20% | 42 | 8.40 | 42 | 8.40 | 0 | 0.00 |
| 3 | Content E-E-A-T | 20% | 45 | 9.00 | 74 | 14.80 | +29 | +5.80 |
| 4 | Technical GEO | 15% | 18 | 2.70 | 90 | 13.50 | +72 | +10.80 |
| 5 | Schema & Structured Data | 10% | 12 | 1.20 | 65 | 6.50 | +53 | +5.30 |
| 6 | Platform Optimization | 10% | 42 | 4.20 | 42 | 4.20 | 0 | 0.00 |
| | **Composite** | **100%** | | **35.00** | | **66.65 → 67** | **+32** | **+31.65** |

### Why Two Categories Are Identical

**Brand Authority (42/100)** and **Platform Optimization (42/100)** are the same for both sites because they measure *off-site* signals — things that exist outside your website:

- How many reviews you have on Google, Yelp, BBB, and Angi
- Whether your Yelp listing is claimed
- Whether you have an Instagram, YouTube, or Houzz profile
- How many third-party directories list your business

Rebuilding your website does not change these signals. They require separate, ongoing business actions (claiming profiles, requesting reviews, creating social media accounts). This is expected and normal — a website rebuild captures all available *on-site* gains, and the remaining improvement comes from *off-site* work.

### Composite Calculation (Shown Transparently)

```
Wix Composite:
  (38 × 0.25) + (42 × 0.20) + (45 × 0.20) + (18 × 0.15) + (12 × 0.10) + (42 × 0.10)
  = 9.50 + 8.40 + 9.00 + 2.70 + 1.20 + 4.20
  = 35.00

Next.js Composite:
  (77 × 0.25) + (42 × 0.20) + (74 × 0.20) + (90 × 0.15) + (65 × 0.10) + (42 × 0.10)
  = 19.25 + 8.40 + 14.80 + 13.50 + 6.50 + 4.20
  = 66.65 → 67 (rounded)

Delta: 67 - 35 = +32 points (+91%)
```

## 4. Category Deep Dives

### 4.1 AI Citability — Wix 38 → Next.js 77 (+39)

**What This Measures:** How easily AI systems can extract specific, quotable facts from your website — prices, specs, timelines, locations, and direct answers to customer questions.

#### Sub-Dimension Comparison

| Sub-Dimension | Wix | Next.js | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Factual density** | Medium | High | Wix: 4 packages + 1 price. Next.js: 4 packages + detailed specs + 15 product types + 3 maintenance tiers + 7 additional services + cost breakdowns |
| **Quotable answers** | Low | High | Wix: 0 FAQs. Next.js: 5 FAQs with specific answers ("6-10 weeks," "$300-600 permits") |
| **Price transparency** | Limited | Good | Wix: 1 price ($51,995). Next.js: same price + additional cost items (permit $300-600, electrical $2,700-3,000, fence $28/LF) |
| **Entity clarity** | Low | High | Wix: owner mentioned in testimonials only. Next.js: named on every page, in schema, in llms.txt |
| **Testimonial quotability** | Medium | Medium | Both sites: 6 real testimonials with full names and project details (identical content) |
| **Service descriptions** | Very Low | High | Wix: 3 generic template placeholders. Next.js: 8 detailed, real service descriptions |
| **Product descriptions** | None | High | Wix: image thumbnails only, no text. Next.js: 5 categories, 15 product types with descriptions |
| **Educational content** | None | None | Neither site has blog posts, guides, or how-to articles |

#### Key Improvements

- **Before:** AI asking "What does an inground pool cost in Minnesota?" could only find one number ($51,995) buried in package details, with no context about what's included vs. what costs extra.
- **After:** AI can cite $51,995 for the complete 18x36 package, plus permit costs ($300-600), gas ($800-1,000), electrical ($2,700-3,000), and fencing ($28/LF) — a complete cost picture.

- **Before:** AI asking "What pool services does Paragon offer?" found 3 generic template descriptions: "Swimming Pool Construction," "Custom Pool Design," "Pool Water Control."
- **After:** AI can cite 8 specific services with real descriptions, a 4-step process, and 5 FAQs with detailed answers.

- **Before:** The Products page was image-only — AI systems that can't process images got zero information.
- **After:** 15 product types across 5 categories, each with a text description that AI can read and cite.

**Business impact:** When a potential customer asks an AI assistant about pool costs, services, or products in your area, the new site provides 5-10x more citable data points than the Wix site did. More citable data means more AI recommendations.

---

### 4.2 Brand Authority — Wix 42 → Next.js 42 (No Change)

**What This Measures:** How much third-party evidence exists across the internet that your business is real, reputable, and active — reviews, directory listings, social media presence, and mentions on external platforms.

#### Sub-Dimension Comparison

| Sub-Dimension | Wix | Next.js | Why Identical |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Review volume** | ~10-12 total | ~10-12 total | Reviews live on Google, Yelp, BBB — not on your website |
| **Review sentiment** | Mixed (Yelp 1.5★) | Mixed (Yelp 1.5★) | External review platforms are unchanged |
| **Directory presence** | 15+ platforms | 15+ platforms | BBB, Angi, Yellow Pages, etc. — all off-site |
| **Social media** | Facebook, LinkedIn (basic) | Facebook, LinkedIn (basic) | Social accounts are separate from the website |
| **Owner personal brand** | No online presence | No online presence | LinkedIn profile, media mentions are off-site |
| **BBB accreditation** | A+ since 1998 | A+ since 1998 | BBB status is off-site |
| **Building permits** | 91 since 1995 | 91 since 1995 | BuildZoom data is off-site |

#### Why This Score Didn't Change

Brand Authority is entirely about signals that exist *outside* your website. Rebuilding the website doesn't create new Google reviews, claim your Yelp listing, or add an Instagram account. These are business actions, not development tasks.

This is normal and expected — **every website rebuild leaves off-site scores unchanged**. The good news: this is the single largest opportunity for improvement, and it requires zero technical work.

#### What Would Move the Needle

| Action | Estimated Impact | Who Does It |
|---|---|---|
| Claim Yelp listing and respond to reviews | +3-5 pts | Business owner (30 minutes) |
| Get 50+ Google reviews over 6 months | +8-12 pts | Business owner + staff (ongoing) |
| Create and maintain Instagram account | +2-3 pts | Business owner or marketing hire |
| Complete Mike Henry's LinkedIn profile | +1-2 pts | Business owner (1 hour) |
| Get listed on Houzz with project photos | +2-3 pts | Business owner (2 hours) |

---

### 4.3 Content E-E-A-T — Wix 45 → Next.js 74 (+29)

**What This Measures:** Whether your content demonstrates real Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness — the four signals AI systems use to decide if a source is credible enough to cite.

#### Sub-Dimension Comparison

| Sub-Dimension | Wix | Next.js | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Experience signals** | Medium | High | Wix: "more than 25 years" (outdated, vague). Next.js: "35+ years, founded 1990, owner in industry since early 1970s" (specific, accurate) |
| **Expertise depth** | Low | High | Wix: 3 generic services. Next.js: 8 detailed services + 4 packages with full specs + equipment model numbers |
| **Data accuracy** | Poor | Good | Wix: hours conflict (9-7 vs 9-6), only 1 location, outdated years. Next.js: consistent hours, all 3 locations, accurate dates |
| **Testimonial quality** | Good | Good | Both: 6 real testimonials with full names and specific project details (identical content) |
| **Location coverage** | 1 of 3 | 3 of 3 | Wix lists only Willernie. Next.js lists Willernie, Stillwater, and Forest Lake with addresses and phones |
| **Founder visibility** | Minimal | Strong | Wix: mentioned in About page text. Next.js: named in schema, every page footer, llms.txt, structured data as "founder" entity |
| **Visual evidence** | Gallery page exists | No gallery page | **Wix advantage:** the Wix site had a Gallery page with project photos. The new site does not yet have this (acknowledged as a gap) |
| **FAQ coverage** | None | 5 Q&As | Wix: zero FAQs anywhere. Next.js: 5 real FAQs with specific answers |
| **Process transparency** | None | 4-step process | Wix: no explanation of how projects work. Next.js: Consultation → Design → Build → Enjoy |
| **Brand partnerships** | Listed on About page | Listed on About page + schema + llms.txt | New site surfaces brand data in 3 places vs. 1 |

#### Honest Acknowledgment: Wix Gallery Page

The Wix site included a Gallery page with project photos — visual evidence of completed work. The new site does not yet have a gallery page. For a pool construction business, visual proof of completed projects is one of the strongest experience signals possible. This is a known gap, and adding a gallery page with real project photography is a high-priority next step.

#### Key Improvements

- **Before:** The "25+ years" claim was outdated and vague — AI systems couldn't determine the actual founding date or tenure.
- **After:** "35+ years, founded 1990" is a specific, verifiable claim that AI can cite confidently.

- **Before:** Hours conflicted between pages (homepage: Mon-Fri 9-7, contact page: Mon-Fri 9-6). Conflicting data causes AI to distrust the source.
- **After:** Hours are consistent everywhere on the site (Mon-Fri 9-7, Sat 9-4, Sun 10-3), sourced from a single data file.

- **Before:** Only 1 of 3 locations was listed. AI searching for "pool builder near Stillwater" or "pool builder Forest Lake" had no matching location data.
- **After:** All 3 locations listed with full addresses, phone numbers, and GPS coordinates in structured data.

**Business impact:** AI systems increasingly evaluate E-E-A-T when deciding which source to cite. A site with consistent data, specific expertise signals, and named experts is cited preferentially over one with generic content and conflicting information.

### 4.4 Technical GEO — Wix 18 → Next.js 90 (+72)

**What This Measures:** Whether AI crawlers can physically access, read, and understand your website at a technical level — rendering method, AI crawler permissions, machine-readable endpoints, and metadata quality.

This is the largest single improvement category, with a **72-point gain**.

#### Sub-Dimension Comparison

| Sub-Dimension | Wix | Next.js | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rendering method** | Client-side JavaScript | Static prerendering (SSG) | Wix loads content via JS; if JS fails, AI sees empty page. Next.js serves complete HTML instantly |
| **AI crawler permissions** | Wix default robots.txt (no AI-specific rules) | 9 AI crawlers explicitly whitelisted | GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, Google-Extended, PerplexityBot, anthropic-ai, Claude-Web, Applebot-Extended, CCBot, cohere-ai |
| **llms.txt endpoint** | Not possible on Wix | Dynamic endpoint at `/llms.txt` | Auto-generated from source data: owner, locations, hours, packages, services, FAQs, brands, service area |
| **Sitemap quality** | Wix auto-generated (no priorities) | Priority-weighted, 8 URLs with change frequencies | Home 1.0, Services/Contact 0.9, Packages/Products/Pricing 0.8, About/Testimonials 0.7 |
| **Per-page Open Graph** | None or basic Wix defaults | Full OG title, description, image, URL per page | Every page has unique, hand-crafted OG metadata |
| **Twitter Card tags** | None | Summary large image cards per page | Enables rich previews on Twitter/X |
| **Canonical URLs** | Not configured | Set per page | Prevents duplicate content signals that confuse AI |
| **Geo meta tags** | None | Region (US-MN), placename (Willernie), GPS coordinates | Explicit geographic signal for "near me" queries |
| **Keywords meta** | None | 18 targeted keywords | "pool builder Stillwater MN," "inground pool contractor Twin Cities," etc. |
| **Semantic HTML** | Wix template divs | `<nav aria-label>`, heading hierarchy, `<details>/<summary>` | Proper structure helps AI parse page sections |
| **Code ownership** | No access (Wix proprietary) | Full source code, git history | Can modify any technical aspect at will |

#### What "Static Prerendering" Means for AI

This is the most important technical difference. Here's what happens when an AI crawler visits each site:

**Wix (client-side rendering):**
1. AI crawler requests the page
2. Server sends a mostly-empty HTML shell with JavaScript instructions
3. AI crawler must execute JavaScript to see the actual content
4. Many AI crawlers (especially newer ones) cannot reliably execute JavaScript
5. Result: AI sees a blank or partially-rendered page

**Next.js (static prerendering):**
1. AI crawler requests the page
2. Server sends the complete, fully-rendered HTML instantly
3. AI crawler reads all content immediately — no JavaScript needed
4. Result: AI sees everything on the page, every time

This single difference accounts for much of the 72-point gap in Technical GEO.

#### What llms.txt Does

The new site includes a dedicated endpoint at `/llms.txt` — a plain-text file designed specifically for AI systems. It contains:

- Business name, owner, founding year
- All 3 locations with addresses
- Operating hours
- All 4 pool packages with specs and pricing
- Chemical package details
- All 8 services with descriptions
- 5 FAQs with complete answers
- Brand partnerships
- Full service area (14 cities)
- Key facts (years in business, awards, on-site owner)

This is like handing AI a business card with every important fact pre-formatted. Wix has no way to create this.

**Business impact:** The 72-point Technical GEO improvement means AI systems went from struggling to read your site at all to having full, instant access to every page plus a dedicated AI summary. This is the difference between being invisible and being readable.

---

### 4.5 Schema & Structured Data — Wix 12 → Next.js 65 (+53)

**What This Measures:** Whether your website includes machine-readable labels (called "schema markup" or "JSON-LD") that tell AI systems exactly what each piece of content represents — "this is a business," "this is a product," "this is a review," "this is a FAQ."

Think of schema as name tags on your content. Without name tags, AI has to guess what things are. With name tags, AI knows instantly.

#### Schema Coverage Matrix

| Schema Type | Wix | Next.js | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LocalBusiness** | Maybe (Wix default, minimal) | Full: 3 addresses, 3 GPS coordinates, hours, 14 service area cities, 9 expertise topics, founder entity | Tells AI "this is a real local business at these locations" |
| **WebSite** | None | Present on all pages | Tells AI "this is an official business website" |
| **BreadcrumbList** | None | All 7 interior pages | Tells AI the page hierarchy (Home > Services > Pool Construction) |
| **FAQPage** | None | 5 Q&As on Services page | Tells AI "these are real questions with verified answers" — enables FAQ rich results |
| **Product** | None | 1 product with $51,995 Offer on Packages page | Tells AI "this is a product you can buy at this price" |
| **Review** | None | 6 reviews on Testimonials page | Tells AI "these are real customer reviews" |
| **Service** | None | Function built (not yet wired up) | Tells AI "this is a specific service this business offers" |
| **HowTo** | None | Not yet built | Would tell AI "this is a step-by-step process" |
| **ContactPoint** | None | Not yet built | Would tell AI "this is how to contact the business" |
| **Person** (founder) | None | Embedded in LocalBusiness schema | Tells AI "this person founded this business" |
| **GeoCoordinates** | None | 3 locations with lat/lng | Tells AI exact locations for "near me" matching |
| **OpeningHoursSpecification** | None | 3 day-range blocks | Tells AI operating hours in machine-readable format |
| **Offer** | None | 1 ($51,995) | Tells AI "this product is available at this price" |

**Wix schema score explained (12/100):** We scored Wix conservatively — giving benefit of the doubt that Wix may auto-inject a minimal LocalBusiness schema with basic business name and address. However, the Wix scrape shows no indicators of structured data beyond possible Wix platform defaults. There is zero FAQPage, Product, Review, Service, BreadcrumbList, HowTo, ContactPoint, or GeoCoordinates schema.

**Next.js schema score explained (65/100):** The new site has 7 working schema generators producing rich structured data. It scores 65 rather than higher because several generators are built but not yet wired up to pages (Service schema on Services page, Product schema on Products page), reviews lack star ratings (no `reviewRating` or `aggregateRating`), and several schema types are still missing (HowTo, ContactPoint).

#### Key Improvements

- **Before:** AI systems had no machine-readable labels for your business data. Everything required text extraction and guessing.
- **After:** 7 schema types label your business, pages, FAQs, products, reviews, and page hierarchy. AI can extract structured entities directly.

- **Before:** No FAQ schema anywhere. AI answering "how long does pool installation take?" had to parse free-form text.
- **After:** 5 FAQs with structured Question/Answer schema — AI can extract "6-10 weeks" directly.

- **Before:** No breadcrumb schema. AI had no understanding of page relationships.
- **After:** Every interior page has BreadcrumbList schema showing the hierarchy.

**Business impact:** Schema markup is the single most direct way to communicate with AI systems. Going from near-zero to 7 working schema types means AI can now extract your business as a structured entity rather than guessing from unstructured text. This translates directly to richer AI mentions — "Paragon Pool & Spa, BBB A+ rated since 1998, starting at $51,995" vs. just a name and URL.

---

### 4.6 Platform Optimization — Wix 42 → Next.js 42 (No Change)

**What This Measures:** How well your business is represented across the third-party platforms that AI systems use as reference sources — Google Business Profile, Yelp, BBB, Houzz, social media, and industry directories.

#### Sub-Dimension Comparison

| Sub-Dimension | Wix | Next.js | Why Identical |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Business Profile** | Not optimized | Not optimized | Google profile is separate from website |
| **Yelp** | Unclaimed (1.5★, 2 reviews) | Unclaimed (1.5★, 2 reviews) | Yelp listing is separate from website |
| **BBB** | A+ accredited since 1998 | A+ accredited since 1998 | BBB profile is separate from website |
| **Facebook** | Present (basic) | Present (basic) | Facebook page is separate from website |
| **Instagram** | Not present | Not present | Instagram requires account creation |
| **YouTube** | Not present | Not present | YouTube requires account creation |
| **Houzz** | Not present | Not present | Houzz requires profile creation |
| **Angi/HomeAdvisor** | Present | Present | Angi profile is separate from website |
| **Industry directories** | ~15 listings | ~15 listings | Directory listings are separate from website |

#### What Would Move the Needle

Like Brand Authority, Platform Optimization requires off-site business actions:

| Action | Estimated Impact | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Claim and optimize Google Business Profile | +5-8 pts | Medium (2-3 hours initially, then ongoing) |
| Claim Yelp listing | +2-3 pts | Low (30 minutes) |
| Create Instagram with project photos | +3-5 pts | Medium (ongoing content creation) |
| Create Houzz profile with project portfolio | +2-3 pts | Medium (2-3 hours initially) |
| Create YouTube channel with project walkthroughs | +2-3 pts | High (video production) |

---

## 5. What Changed vs. What Stayed the Same

### Website Improvements (4 Categories Changed)

These four categories improved because they measure *on-site* qualities — things controlled by how your website is built:

| Category | Improvement | What Changed |
|---|---|---|
| **Technical GEO** | +72 pts (18 → 90) | Static rendering, 9 AI crawlers whitelisted, llms.txt endpoint, per-page metadata, semantic HTML, code ownership |
| **Schema & Structured Data** | +53 pts (12 → 65) | 7 schema generators (LocalBusiness, WebSite, Breadcrumb, FAQ, Product, Review, Service) |
| **AI Citability** | +39 pts (38 → 77) | 8 real services (vs. 3 generic), 15 products with descriptions, 5 FAQs, 3 maintenance tiers, consistent data |
| **Content E-E-A-T** | +29 pts (45 → 74) | Accurate dates, 3 locations (vs. 1), consistent hours, founder visibility, brand partnerships in schema |

### Business Presence (2 Categories Unchanged)

These two categories didn't change because they measure *off-site* qualities — things that exist on other platforms:

| Category | Score | Why Unchanged |
|---|---|---|
| **Brand Authority** | 42 (both) | Reviews, directory claims, social media, and owner personal brand are all off-site |
| **Platform Optimization** | 42 (both) | Google, Yelp, Instagram, Houzz, and industry directories are all separate platforms |

### The Key Insight

The website rebuild captured **all available on-site gains**. The four website-controlled categories jumped by an average of 48 points. The remaining 33 points to reach 100 require **off-site business work** — getting reviews, claiming profiles, and building authority on external platforms. This is the natural next phase: the foundation is built, and now the business presence needs to be built on top of it.

## 6. Business Impact

### What a 32-Point GEO Improvement Means

GEO scores aren't abstract numbers — they translate directly to how AI systems treat your business when answering customer questions.

#### Example: "Who builds inground pools near Stillwater, MN?"

**Before (Wix, GEO 35):**
AI systems would struggle to find your site (JavaScript rendering), find minimal structured data if they did, see conflicting hours, only 1 location listed, and generic service descriptions. Result: **your business is unlikely to appear in the AI's answer**.

**After (Next.js, GEO 67):**
AI systems get complete HTML instantly, find rich schema with 3 locations and 14 service area cities, see your specific packages with pricing, read 5 FAQs with expert answers, and find a dedicated llms.txt summary. Result: **your business is a strong candidate for the AI's answer**, with specific facts to cite.

#### Example: "What does an inground pool cost in Minnesota?"

**Before (Wix, GEO 35):**
AI might find "$51,995" but with no context — no breakdown of what's included, no additional costs mentioned, no FAQ explaining the process. The AI might mention the price but can't give a useful answer about your business.

**After (Next.js, GEO 67):**
AI can cite: "$51,995 for a complete 18x36 package including Hayward SuperPump, 250K BTU heater, Polaris robotic cleaner, plus additional costs — permits $300-600, gas $800-1,000, electrical $2,700-3,000, fencing $28/LF. Timeline: 6-10 weeks. Paragon Pool & Spa, BBB A+ rated since 1998, 35+ years in business."

That's the difference between a mention and a *recommendation*.

#### Example: "Pool builders Twin Cities reviews"

**Before and after:** This query still relies heavily on off-site review data (Google, Yelp, BBB). The website rebuild doesn't change your 1.5-star Yelp or ~10 total reviews. This is where the off-site work becomes critical.

### Competitive Positioning

Your competitors in the Twin Cities pool builder market are almost certainly running standard template websites (Wix, Squarespace, WordPress themes) without:
- AI crawler whitelisting
- llms.txt endpoints
- Rich schema markup
- Structured FAQ content
- Machine-readable pricing

A GEO score of 67 likely puts you ahead of every competitor for AI visibility. When a potential customer asks ChatGPT or Perplexity for pool builder recommendations in your area, you're structured to be cited first.

### ROI Context

Consider the math on a single conversion:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average complete pool package | $51,995 |
| Potential maintenance customer lifetime value | $1,500-$3,000/year |
| Cost of one lost lead to a competitor | Entire package revenue ($51,995+) |

The investment in a GEO-optimized website needs to generate **one additional qualified lead per year** to deliver substantial ROI. With AI search growing as a lead source, being the structured, citable business in your market is a compounding advantage.

## 7. Roadmap to 80+

The current score of 67 can reach 80+ within 6 months through three tiers of work. Each recommendation is tagged with effort level, estimated impact, and who should own it.

### Tier 1: Quick Wins (0-2 Weeks) — Estimated Impact: +5-8 Points

These are low-effort changes that can be implemented immediately.

| # | Action | Impact | Effort | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Wire up existing `generateServiceSchema()` on Services page (8 services) | +2 pts | 15 minutes | Developer |
| 2 | Add `rating: 5` to all 6 testimonials + `aggregateRating` to Review schema | +1-2 pts | 15 minutes | Developer |
| 3 | Add Product schema to Products page (15 items, code pattern exists) | +1-2 pts | 30 minutes | Developer |
| 4 | Create branded og:image.jpg (1200x630) | +0.5 pts | 30 minutes | Developer/Designer |
| 5 | Configure custom domain (paragonpoolandspa.com) on Vercel | +1 pt | 15 minutes | Developer |
| 6 | Add 4-5 additional AI crawlers to robots.txt (Bytespider, Meta-ExternalAgent, Amazonbot, YouBot) | +0.5 pts | 10 minutes | Developer |
| 7 | Claim Yelp listing and respond to reviews | +2-3 pts | 30 minutes | Business owner |

### Tier 2: Content Expansion (2-8 Weeks) — Estimated Impact: +5-8 Points

These require content creation and research.

| # | Action | Impact | Effort | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | Add project gallery page with real photos | +3-4 pts | 2-4 hours (photography + development) | Business owner + Developer |
| 9 | Add price ranges to remaining 3 packages ("Starting at $44,000") | +1-2 pts | 30 minutes | Business owner + Developer |
| 10 | Create first 3 educational articles (pool cost guide, winterization, maintenance checklist) | +2-3 pts | 8-12 hours | Business owner (expertise) + Developer (publishing) |
| 11 | Add HowTo schema for 4-step process on Services page | +0.5 pts | 20 minutes | Developer |
| 12 | Add ContactPoint schema on Contact page | +0.5 pts | 15 minutes | Developer |
| 13 | Add privacy policy page | +0.5 pts | 1 hour | Developer |
| 14 | Add dates to testimonials (approximate years) | +0.5 pts | 15 minutes | Business owner + Developer |

### Tier 3: Off-Site Authority (Ongoing) — Estimated Impact: +10-15 Points

These require sustained business effort over months.

| # | Action | Impact | Effort | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | Launch review generation campaign (target 50+ Google reviews in 6 months) | +8-12 pts | Ongoing (ask every satisfied customer) | Business owner + Staff |
| 16 | Claim and optimize Google Business Profile for all 3 locations | +3-5 pts | 3-4 hours initial setup | Business owner |
| 17 | Create Instagram account and post project photos regularly | +2-3 pts | Ongoing (1-2 posts/week) | Business owner or Marketing |
| 18 | Complete Mike Henry's LinkedIn profile with industry history and awards | +1-2 pts | 1-2 hours | Business owner |
| 19 | Get listed on Houzz with project portfolio | +1-2 pts | 2-3 hours initial setup | Business owner |
| 20 | Fix Forest Lake "permanently closed" on Birdeye (if still operating) | +0.5 pts | 30 minutes | Business owner |
| 21 | Contact Latham Pools to restore dealer directory page | +0.5 pts | 30 minutes | Business owner |

### Projected Score Timeline

| Timeframe | Projected Score | What's Done |
|---|---|---|
| **Today** | **67/100 (Fair)** | Website rebuild complete |
| **30 days** | **73-75/100 (Fair→Good)** | Quick wins + Yelp claim + og:image + custom domain |
| **60 days** | **76-79/100 (Good)** | Gallery page + pricing transparency + first articles |
| **90 days** | **80-83/100 (Good)** | 20+ new reviews + Google Business Profile + Instagram active |
| **180 days** | **85-88/100 (Good→Excellent)** | 50+ reviews + Houzz + 5+ articles + full schema coverage |

The path from 67 to 80+ is clear and achievable. The first 8 points come from completing the on-site work already started. The remaining 5-8 points come from building off-site authority — which compounds over time.

## 8. Methodology

### Scoring Formula

The GEO Composite Score is calculated as a weighted average of six category scores:

```
GEO Score = (AI Citability × 0.25) + (Brand Authority × 0.20) + (Content E-E-A-T × 0.20) +
            (Technical GEO × 0.15) + (Schema & Structured Data × 0.10) + (Platform Optimization × 0.10)
```

**Weight rationale:**
- **AI Citability (25%):** The most direct measure of whether AI can quote and recommend your business
- **Brand Authority (20%):** AI systems heavily weigh third-party trust signals
- **Content E-E-A-T (20%):** Google's and AI's primary content quality framework
- **Technical GEO (15%):** Critical enabler — if AI can't access the site, nothing else matters
- **Schema & Structured Data (10%):** Important for entity extraction, but secondary to content quality
- **Platform Optimization (10%):** Supports discovery but has diminishing returns beyond core platforms

### Score Interpretation Scale

| Range | Rating | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Top-tier GEO; highly likely to be cited by AI |
| 75-89 | Good | Strong foundation with room to improve |
| 60-74 | Fair | Moderate presence; significant opportunities |
| 40-59 | Poor | Weak signals; AI struggles to cite or recommend |
| 0-39 | Critical | Largely invisible to AI systems |

### Data Sources

| Source | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Wix site scrape | `scripts/scraped-data/wix-content.md` | All "before" evidence — scraped via Playwright headless Chromium on 2026-02-26 |
| New site codebase | Project root (`src/`, `public/`) | All "after" evidence — direct code inspection |
| GEO Audit Report | `GEO-AUDIT-REPORT.md` | All Next.js scores (used exactly as published) |
| Schema generators | `src/lib/schema.ts` | 7 generator functions proving schema coverage |
| AI crawler config | `src/app/robots.ts` | 9 AI crawler user-agent rules |
| llms.txt endpoint | `src/app/llms.txt/route.ts` | Dynamic AI-readable business summary |
| Existing comparison | `docs/audit/wix-vs-nextjs-comparison.md` | Cross-referenced for consistency |
| Platform searches | Live web searches during audit | Brand authority and platform optimization evidence |

### Notes on Scoring Integrity

**Off-site score identity:** Brand Authority (42) and Platform Optimization (42) are intentionally identical for both sites. These categories measure signals outside the website. Claiming otherwise would be dishonest.

**Wix schema benefit of the doubt:** The Wix Schema & Structured Data score (12) gives credit for possible Wix auto-injected LocalBusiness markup, even though the scrape showed no direct evidence of it. This is conservative scoring in Wix's favor.

**Honest gap acknowledgment:** The Wix site had a Gallery page with project photos. The new site does not yet have a gallery. Visual evidence is an E-E-A-T strength, and its absence on the new site is reflected in the Content E-E-A-T scoring. The new site scores higher overall due to improvements across every other dimension, but this specific gap is real and should be addressed.

**Next.js scores are exact:** Every Next.js score in this comparison matches the GEO Audit Report (`GEO-AUDIT-REPORT.md`) exactly — no rounding or adjustment.

### Appendix D: AI Crawler Access Matrix

| AI Crawler | Platform | Wix | Next.js |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPTBot | ChatGPT (OpenAI) | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| ChatGPT-User | ChatGPT browse mode | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| Google-Extended | Gemini (Google) | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity AI | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| anthropic-ai | Claude (Anthropic) | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| Claude-Web | Claude web search | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| Applebot-Extended | Siri / Apple Intelligence | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| CCBot | Common Crawl | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| cohere-ai | Cohere AI models | Covered by wildcard `*` | **Explicitly whitelisted** |
| Bytespider | TikTok / ByteDance | Covered by wildcard `*` | Covered by wildcard `*` |
| Meta-ExternalAgent | Meta AI | Covered by wildcard `*` | Covered by wildcard `*` |
| Amazonbot | Alexa / Amazon | Covered by wildcard `*` | Covered by wildcard `*` |
| YouBot | You.com | Covered by wildcard `*` | Covered by wildcard `*` |

**Key difference:** Wix uses a default robots.txt with no AI-specific rules. The wildcard `*` rule technically allows all crawlers, but explicit whitelisting signals *intent* — it tells AI systems "we want you here, and here's exactly what you can and can't access." Additionally, Wix's client-side rendering means even allowed crawlers may get empty content.

The new site explicitly whitelists 9 crawlers with specific access rules (allow `/`, disallow `/api/`) and serves fully-rendered HTML that any crawler can read without JavaScript.

### Appendix E: Glossary

| Term | Plain English Definition |
|---|---|
| **GEO** | Generative Engine Optimization — making your website easy for AI systems to find and recommend |
| **AI Crawler** | A program that reads websites on behalf of AI systems (like GPTBot reads sites for ChatGPT) |
| **Schema Markup** | Machine-readable labels added to your website that tell AI and search engines exactly what each piece of content is |
| **JSON-LD** | The specific code format used to add schema markup — invisible to visitors, readable by machines |
| **E-E-A-T** | Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness — the four criteria Google and AI use to evaluate content quality |
| **llms.txt** | A special page on your website formatted specifically for AI systems to read — like a business card for AI |
| **robots.txt** | A file that tells search engines and AI crawlers what they're allowed to read on your site |
| **Sitemap** | A file that lists every page on your site with priority rankings — helps crawlers find content efficiently |
| **Open Graph (OG)** | Tags that control how your pages appear when shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms |
| **Canonical URL** | A tag that tells search engines "this is the official version of this page" — prevents duplicate content issues |
| **Static Prerendering (SSG)** | Building complete HTML pages in advance so they load instantly — versus making the visitor's browser build the page |
| **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** | Making the visitor's browser run JavaScript to build the page — many AI crawlers can't do this |
| **Knowledge Panel** | The information box Google shows on the right side of search results for recognized businesses |
| **Rich Results** | Enhanced search result appearances — star ratings, FAQ dropdowns, breadcrumb trails — unlocked by schema markup |
| **NAP** | Name, Address, Phone — the three data points that must be identical everywhere for AI trust |
| **Entity** | A recognized "thing" in AI's understanding — a business, a person, a product, a location |
| **Structured Data** | Any data formatted so machines can read it automatically (schema markup is one type) |
| **SSG** | Static Site Generation — pages are built at deploy time, not when visitors request them |
| **CDN** | Content Delivery Network — a global network of servers that delivers your site from the nearest location to each visitor |
| **Webhook** | An automatic notification sent from one system to another — used to route leads from your site to a CRM |
